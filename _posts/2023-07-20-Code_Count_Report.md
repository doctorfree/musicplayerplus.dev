## MusicPlayerPlus Code Count Report

The following code count data was generated using David A. Wheeler's
[SLOCCount tool](https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/). Thanks David!

This data was generated using the source code for
[MusicPlayerPlus v2.0.1r3](https://github.com/doctorfree/MusicPlayerPlus/releases/tag/v2.0.1r3).

With over 188,000 lines of code and an estimated nearly 50 person-years
to develop, MusicPlayerPlus represents an estimated $6,609,913 to develop.
It's free to use, copy, modify, redistribute, even sell if you want. That
is, you are getting an estimated $6.6 Million asset free of charge and without
much constraint on what you can do with it.
